# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

•	Took part in a Kaggle Analytics challenge to predict if a passenger on the Titanic would survive or not.

•	Cleaned and processed the dataset for prediction on R software.

•	Performed univariate, bi-variate and multi-variate analysis.

•	Feature engineered to read and resolve the data parameters ambiguity.

•	Used advanced Machine Learning classification algorithms like Naïve Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, K-NN, Decision Trees and Random Forest to build models and compared the efficiency of the models based on the accuracy of predictions.
